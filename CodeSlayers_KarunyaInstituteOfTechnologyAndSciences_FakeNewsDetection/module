	Fake news detection is the process of identifying and classifying false or misleading information 
presented as news. With the widespread availability of social media and the internet, fake news has become 
a growing problem that can have serious consequences. It can spread quickly, influence public opinion, and 
even impact political and social outcomes.
The detection of fake news is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the news and information we 
receive. Detecting fake news involves using specialized techniques and algorithms to identify patterns and 
markers that are indicative of fake news. These methods involve analysing language, content, and sources 
to determine the credibility and accuracy of the information presented.
Overall, fake news detection is an essential tool in protecting the public from misinformation and 
ensuring that news and information are accurate and trustworthy.
	We have used two datasets, one with real news articles and the other with fake news articles. 
We have concatenated these datasets and added a new column "label" to identify whether the news article 
is real or fake.
We have visualized the distribution of news articles across different subjects using a count plot.
	Logistic regression is a popular model for binary classification problems. 
It uses a logistic function to model the probability of the output class. We have used logistic regression 
because it is a simple and effective model for binary classification problems. 
It is also easy to interpret and understand the results.
	We have used the accuracy score to evaluate the performance of the model on both the training and 
testing sets. 
We have also used the confusion matrix to understand the performance of the model in classifying the news
articles as real or fake.
